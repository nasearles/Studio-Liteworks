### Capabilities
- Studio Liteworks allows users to connect up to 8 lighting devices at once and select their colors or animations individually or as a group.
- It offers more lighting control than any remote ever could by providing the ability to select which devices are being targeted.
- It also supports animation and music matching capabilities using firmware in the hub, and an auto gain mic running a fast fourier transform on noise picked up in the vicinity

### Future Improvements
- Wireless connectivity to each device
- On board, stored functionality without requiring desktop connection
- Brightness and timing control for each individual bar (instead of global brightness)
- Animation Creator Studio: set colors, brightness, and timing at selected intervals to create your own animations
- More onboard animations
- Variety of different compatibale lighting devices
